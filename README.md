# Hey, If you're here, you either want to get to know more about me, or are interested in one of my projects. You're in the right place!

I build practical software and applied AI systems that turn messy, real-world workflows into reliable products.  
Recently: agentic RAG + automation for large config/testbed systems, and full-stack tooling that’s fast to ship and easy to own.

## TLDR
- Built an agentic search + automation workflow over **5,000+** real network/testbed configs, cutting config discovery from **hours → seconds**
- Shipped production-grade full-stack features across React/TypeScript + backend services, focusing on reliability, rollout safety, and developer UX
- Designed pipelines for ingestion/indexing/retrieval (structured + vector) with strong emphasis on cost control and fast “first-stage” retrieval
- Comfortable owning systems end-to-end: APIs, data stores, infra, CI/CD, and polished UI

## Featured Projects

### 1) RL-Based Test Case Prioritization for CI/CD
**Problem:** CI delays when the wrong tests run first.  
**What I built:** Online/learning-based prioritization to surface failures earlier and reduce feedback time.  
**Tech:** Python, RL (DQN), custom environments, evaluation dashboards

### 2) Brevity Cloud (AI Summarizer / RAG System)
**Problem:** Summarize and query long content quickly with reliable retrieval.  
**What I built:** Cloud-deployed summarization + search pipeline with scalable infra and automation.  
**Tech:** AWS (S3, DynamoDB, Kendra/Bedrock), Terraform, API Gateway, Cognito  
Repo: https://github.com/The-Brevity-Cloud/term-project-team4-brevitycloud

### 3) Market Microstructure Backtest + Cost Modeling
**Problem:** Estimate execution cost across many venues efficiently.  
**What I built:** Streaming snapshot processing + greedy allocator to scale when brute force isn’t feasible.  
**Tech:** Python, Kafka, AWS/EC2, Terraform  
Repo: https://github.com/sanjeevmax6/quant-dev-trial-sanjeev

## Tech I Use
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, SQL  
**Backend:** FastAPI, Node.js, PostgreSQL  
**AI/ML:** RAG, embeddings, vector search, RL (DQN)  
**Cloud/Infra:** AWS, Terraform, Docker, CI/CD  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js
