      <h2>Hey, I’m Sanjeev</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a software engineer who likes building systems that live at the edge of
        <b>backend, infrastructure, and applied AI</b> with a strong frontend sensibility.
        I enjoy tackling problems that start off unclear or messy, and turning them into
        tools people actually trust and use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always curious, never afraid to ask questions that raise the bar.
      </p>

### How I think & build
```ts
const sanjeev = {
  experience: {
    areas: ["frontend", "backend", "machine learning", "agentic AI"],
    organizations: ["Nokia", "Skillz"]
  },
  stack: [
    "Python",
    "TypeScript / JavaScript",
    "C++",
    "React",
    "PostgreSQL",
    "AWS",
    "Terraform",
    "Docker"
  ],
  principles: [
    "clarity before cleverness",
    "optimize for iteration and ownership",
    "measure real-world impact"
  ]
};
```

I believe new ideas make things better — after all, the microwave was invented by accident.
