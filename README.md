<p>
I’m a software engineer who likes building systems that live at the edge of <b>backend, infrastructure, and applied AI</b> with a nice touch of <i>Frontend</i>.  
I enjoy tackling problems that start off unclear, messy & turning them into tools people actually trust and use.
</p>

<p>
Always curious, never afraid to ask questions that raise the bar.

  ]

I believe in new ideas making things better. After all, the microwave was invented by accident.
