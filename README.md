<h2>Hey, I’m Sanjeev 👋</h2>

<p>
I’m a software engineer who likes building systems that live at the edge of <b>backend, infrastructure, and applied AI</b>.  
I enjoy tackling problems that start off unclear, messy & turning them into tools people actually trust and use.
</p>

<p>
Always curious, and never fails to ask questions that potentially raise the bar!
